                  themselves through music production in ways words couldnâ€™t.
                  Younger students (aged 4-8) learned core concepts of rhythm
                  while playing boomwhackers and tambourines, learning to calm
                  themselves by breathing intentionally in time with the rhythm.

                  , opening their horizons up to digital music production. We
                  made class beats and hosted beat battles, while focusing on
                  the healthy outlet that music creation can be to unwanted
                  feelings. Watching my students grow as people by learning to
                  produce, it was clear to me that my goal to make music
                  education more accessible was bigger than teaching kids how to
                  make beats.
